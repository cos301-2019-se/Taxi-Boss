/**
 * The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
 * different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is
 * used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). The error model is designed to be:
 * - Simple to use and understand for most users - Flexible enough to meet
 * unexpected needs  # Overview  The `Status` message contains three pieces of
 * data: error code, error message, and error details. The error code should be
 * an enum value of google.rpc.Code, but it may accept additional error codes if
 * needed.  The error message should be a developer-facing English message that
 * helps developers *understand* and *resolve* the error. If a localized
 * user-facing error message is needed, put the localized message in the error
 * details or localize it in the client. The optional error details may contain
 * arbitrary information about the error. There is a predefined set of error
 * detail types in the package `google.rpc` that can be used for common error
 * conditions.  # Language mapping  The `Status` message is the logical
 * representation of the error model, but it is not necessarily the actual wire
 * format. When the `Status` message is exposed in different client libraries
 * and different wire protocols, it can be mapped differently. For example, it
 * will likely be mapped to some exceptions in Java, but more likely mapped to
 * some error codes in C.  # Other uses  The error model and the `Status`
 * message can be used in a variety of environments, either with or without
 * APIs, to provide a consistent developer experience across different
 * environments.  Example uses of this error model include:  - Partial errors.
 * If a service needs to return partial errors to the client,     it may embed
 * the `Status` in the normal response to indicate the partial     errors.  -
 * Workflow errors. A typical workflow has multiple steps. Each step may
 * have a `Status` message for error reporting.  - Batch operations. If a client
 * uses batch request and batch response, the     `Status` message should be
 * used directly inside batch response, one for     each error sub-response.  -
 * Asynchronous operations. If an API call embeds asynchronous operation
 * results in its response, the status of those operations should be
 * represented directly using the `Status` message.  - Logging. If some API
 * errors are stored in logs, the message `Status` could     be used directly
 * after any stripping needed for security/privacy reasons.
