# give_rating

This project creates the page that allows a user to rate a driver. 

`
` 
####The user can rate a ride based on:
>Their comfort level,
>The driver's etiquette, and
>How safe they felt during the ride.

This will be further updated in the future..

>Once a user has rated the driver, an average is calcuated and those 3 values are sent to the database. We do not store the user's details, as we'd like the ratings to remain annonymous. 

>The driver can then see their total score rating from the driver app.
